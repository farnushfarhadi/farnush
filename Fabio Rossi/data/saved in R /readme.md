I am savinf RData here so that I can quickly load then again. 

### preprocessing steps

- download original text data
- checked for same order of genes 
- filtered `LOWDATA` genes (312)
- filtered genes labeled `FAIL` in at least one experiment (18)


So there are `23516` genes in total in each of the cell types.
